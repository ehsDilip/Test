The Card is neither a gift card, a credit card, nor a deposit account debit card. THERE IS NO, CREDIT LINE, CREDIT CARD, OVERDRAFT PROTECTION, OR DEPOSIT ACCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR CARD. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY INTEREST ON FUNDS LOADED TO THE CARD. The monetary value accessible through use of the Card is limited to the funds that you have previously loaded to the Card or that have been loaded to the Card on your behalf.

However, we may use the term “account” and related terms for convenience from time to time when communicating with you about the Card and transactions and inquiries made with the Card. You may access the funds loaded to the Card and perform Card transactions only as described in this Agreement. You cannot link the Card to any deposit or credit account that you may have with us or with any other financial institution, except as provided in this Agreement. You may not obtain or write checks or drafts to access Card funds. In our sole discretion we may refuse to issue a Card to anyone for any reason. The issuance of Cards may not be available in all states. Because your name will not appear on the front of a <NOBR>non-personalized</NOBR> Card, merchants who require identity verification may be unwilling to accept such Card. You may request a personalized Card by calling the customer service telephone number and requesting a personalized card. There is a fee for a personalized card (see the Reissue Fee on an Unexpired Card section in the Card Fee Schedule). Upon activation of your personalized Card, any funds remaining on your non- personalized Card will be available on your personalized Card.</P>

Termination, whether by you or by Issuer, shall not affect prior transactions or obligations relating to your Card existing at the time of termination. Upon termination or surrender of the Card, any remaining balance, minus any applicable fees, charges and transactions, will be refunded to you. The Card is not for resale.</P>

However, your responsibility for transactions with the Card, as described in this Agreement, does not depend on whether or not you sign your Card. If a PIN is established by you or us for use with the Card, you agree (i) not to provide the PIN or the Card to any person; (ii) not to write your PIN on the Card or anything else likely to fall into the wrong hands, and not to do anything else that would cause or increase the risk of unauthorized or fraudulent use of the Card; and (iii) to keep the Card and the PIN in a safe place and to otherwise protect the Card and PIN from fraudulent or unauthorized use. You are responsible for all transactions initiated by use of your Card. If you give someone your Card, Card number or PIN, you are authorizing that person to use your Card, and you will be responsible for all transactions that person performs while using your Card. All transactions that person performs even fraudulent transactions and transactions you did not intend or want to have performed, are authorized transactions.</SPAN></P>
                <P class="p46 ft3"><SPAN class="ft0">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft22">Transactions with Your Card; Limitations. </SPAN>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, when funds have been loaded on your Card, you may use the Card as follows:</P>

                <P class="p49 ft3">You may use your Card for reload transactions as described in this Agreement.</P>
                <P class="p50 ft3">Some of these services may not be available at all terminals or on all electronic funds transfer networks, and some merchants or other third parties may not accept the Card for all transactions and services. We will not be liable or responsible for any merchant’s inability or refusal to honor your Card.</P>
                <P class="p51 ft1">These transactions and services may be described in more detail in other parts of this Agreement, and subject to additional terms and conditions. For security reasons, we may from time to time impose additional limits or restrictions on the number and dollar amount or types of transfers or transactions that you can make using your Card and/or PIN. Also, your ability to initiate transactions may be limited by the terms of other agreements you have with us or as described in other disclosures we have made to you, or by applicable law. You agree to abide by and be bound by all applicable limitations, and you acknowledge that we may change applicable limitations at any time in our sole discretion.</P>
                <P class="p52 ft3">To activate your card for international use, you must first contact customer service at (855) 328- 7243 (PAID) and provide the dates of your travel and the country(ies) you will be visiting. Certain countries are not supported for international transactions.</P>

For security reasons, we reserve the right to change the amount that may be loaded on the Card at any time, without notice. We reserve the right to accept, reject, or limit the total amount loaded to your Card and to accept or reject any request to reload value to the Card in our sole and absolute discretion. We reserve the right to monitor and report any suspicious activity.</P>
                <P class="p40 ft1"><SPAN class="ft2">7.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft23">Availability of Loads. </SPAN>Our policy is to make funds loaded to your Card available immediately but not later than the next Business Day following the day of the load. Availability or use of funds loaded to the Card may be delayed or denied in the event of technology malfunctions, actions of third parties, terms and conditions of third party reload services, pursuant to our compliance with or discharge of legal or regulatory responsibilities, your arrangement with Business or third parties, or as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Third party fees may apply for Card reload transactions, which vary by the applicable reload network.”</P>
                <P class="p55 ft1"><SPAN class="ft2">8.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft23">FDIC Insurance. </SPAN>Funds loaded to your Card are insured by the Federal Deposit</P>
                <P class="p56 ft3">Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), subject to the rules and regulations of the FDIC. For more information about FDIC insurance, visit www.fdic.gov. Funds you load to your Card will not be eligible for FDIC insurance until such funds are received by us.</P>
                <P class="p57 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">9.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft23">Authorization and Payment of Transactions. </SPAN><SPAN class="ft1">You promise to use the Card to make only the types of transactions we have approved. You agree that we may process any Card transactions properly authorized through the use of the PIN, or through your signature or the signature of an authorized person using the Card, as the case may be, or otherwise authorized by you or any person using the Card with your consent or authorization. You appoint as your </SPAN><NOBR><SPAN class="ft1">attorney-in-fact</SPAN></NOBR><SPAN class="ft1"> for any transactions or inquiries involving your Card each and every person who receives or otherwise uses the Card with your consent or authorization. All persons using the Card are bound by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You agree that the methods and procedures for the authorization and authentication of Card transactions described in and contemplated by this Agreement constitute commercially reasonable security procedures for electronic funds transactions under applicable law. You authorize us to use the funds stored on your Card to pay the total amount of any transactions originated by use of the Card, any charges and any applicable fees. Your use of the Card for a payment, transfer, or cash withdrawal is regarded as a withdrawal from and/or use of Card funds at the time the Card is used, even if the transaction is not posted at that time, and you authorize us to deduct the amount of the transaction, charges and any applicable fees at that time.</SPAN></P>
                <P class="p58 ft1"><SPAN class="ft2">10.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft24">Authorization Holds. </SPAN>We and/or some merchants (e.g., restaurants and other merchants who accept gratuities, gas stations, or hotels) may request preauthorization for a Card transaction in the purchase amount plus an estimated additional amount to ensure there are sufficient funds available to cover tips, incidental expenses, or the estimated final purchase amount. Such a preauthorization request may result in a “hold” on your available Card funds in the amount submitted for preauthorization (“Authorization Hold”). Once the final amount of the transaction is determined and has been processed and settled, your Card will be debited for final amount and the Authorization Hold will be removed. During the period of any Authorization Hold, the Card funds that are subject to the Authorization Hold will generally not be available for other Card transactions. We will have no liability to you in the event we decline any Card transaction because an Authorization Hold is in place. We reserve the right to release, in our sole discretion, any Authorization Hold in order to make funds available for other Card transactions, and if we do so we will have no liability to you if we subsequently reject the transaction corresponding to the Authorization Hold due to insufficient Card funds. We will have no liability to you in the event any merchant delays or fails to complete the final processing of any Card transaction that corresponds to an Authorization Hold, and/or in the event any merchant requests an Authorization Hold in error. In general, we will not be responsible for any transactions generated in error by merchants, processing agencies, or any other third parties not under our control, except as may be required under applicable law. During the period of any Authorization Hold the</P>

                <P class="p44 ft3">Card balance reported to you might not reflect that the Authorization Hold is or was in place because available balances are sometimes based on actual debits or credits to your Card rather than on Authorization Holds. You are responsible for knowing when you have initiated a Card transaction that might result in an Authorization Hold and for managing other Card transactions accordingly during the period of an Authorization Hold.</P>
                <P class="p51 ft3"><SPAN class="ft0">11.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">Shortages. </SPAN>You must have a sufficient balance of funds on the Card at the time of a transaction in order to perform the transaction. If you attempt a Card transaction for an amount that is greater than the available balance on your Card, we have no obligation to approve that transaction, even if we previously have approved other insufficient funds transactions. In the event that we, in our sole discretion, settle or pay a transaction with your Card when there are insufficient funds stored on the Card to pay for the transaction, this will result in a negative funds balance on your Card. You agree immediately to pay us the amount of the negative funds balance and any applicable fees without further demand by us, subject to the requirements of applicable law or regulation. We may deduct the amount of the negative balance and applicable fees from any funds subsequently loaded onto your Card, subject to the requirements of applicable law or regulation.</P>
                <P class="p46 ft3"><SPAN class="ft0">12.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">Balance and Transaction History. </SPAN>It is your responsibility to keep a record of the loads, withdrawals, fees, and other transactions on your Card so that you always will know the current balance of funds on your Card. You may inquire about the balance of funds available on your Card (i) at any ATM Terminal, (ii) by calling us at the customer service telephone number provided in this Agreement, or (iii) online at www.agileprepaid.com,. When you conduct a transaction at a Terminal, you generally will be provided with a receipt for the transaction; however, you may not receive a receipt from the Terminal owner for certain small value transactions. We will not mail you a periodic statement regarding your Card transactions, except as required by applicable law, however, you may obtain a history of your Card transactions as described above. Because of operational constraints related to processing or posting transactions on your Card, balance information and transaction histories you obtain may not reflect transactions that are still in process at the time the information is provided. If you request a balance inquiry at an ATM Terminal, if you request to speak in person to one of our call center agents, or if you request us to mail a written transaction history to you, you may be charged a fee as disclosed in this Agreement.</P>
                <P class="p58 ft3"><SPAN class="ft0">13.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft25">Transactions with Merchants. </SPAN>You may not stop payment on any Card purchase transaction, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. We are not responsible for the quality of goods, property, or services you purchase with the Card. Any claims concerning goods, property, or services purchased with the Card must be resolved by you directly with the merchant or seller who accepted the Card, and any claim or defense that you assert against such merchant or seller will not relieve you of your responsibility to us for the total amount of the Card transaction. If you are entitled to a refund for goods or services obtained with your Card, you agree to accept credits to your Card for such refunds. No cash refunds will be made by us to you on Card purchases.
