Thanks for trying my code.

Instructions.
1. Place the files somewhere on your server.
2. Include the files in your code
3. Call the functions you need & parse the returned data to display

Here's some sample code for including & loading the data.
I'll assume if you've gotten this far, you can parse arrays. =)
<?php
	include_once('wp-content/themes/exampletheme/assets/classes/Pinterest.class.php');
	$pinterest = new Pinterest();
	$pinterest->scrapeUser("username");
	$pinterestCovers = $pinterest->getCovers();
	$pinterestThumbs = $pinterest->getThumbs();
	$pinterestLinks = $pinterest->getLinks();
?>

*NOTE: $pinterest->getThumbs() returns an array of arrays. Each array corresponds to a cover photo.

Questions? Just a leave a comment & I'll get back to you.
